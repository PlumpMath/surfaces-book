* About this book
This book intends to provide a freely available resource on concepts in surface science. You are free to copy this work, redistribute, even print and sell the work, provided you adhere to the terms in the [[license]]. 

The book is a work in progress and is being used to teach a course titled "Surfaces and adsorption".

** Python
The book uses Python wherever numerical analysis is required. Python is similar in nature to Matlab, but is freely available. We have attempted to introduce the language by examples throughout the book. If you are a new user, you should start at the beginning of the book. If you are experienced with Matlab, the syntax should be easy to read. We recommend the following Python distribution for use with this book.

- Enthought Python Distribution (http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php)
This package is free for academic use, and available for Windows, Macs and Linux. The package includes all the typical python libraries needed for numerical, scientific and graphics computing. 

- An alternative python environment that may be suitable is Python(x,y) (http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/). This distribution is Windows focused, and there are not Mac or Linux installers available.

- For editing/writing python code, I like the Spyder editor (http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/). It is also available for Windows, Macs and Linux. You may find the IDLE or SciTE editor that comes with Enthought suitable though.

* Introduction
** The Importance of Solid Surfaces

-	We have never seen anything but the surface of an object.

-	Catalysis.  Over 90% of all commodity chemical are produced or processed through the use of heterogeneous catalysts.  These catalysts are: dispersed metal particles, high surface area zeolites, finely divided oxide powders.

-	Corrosion.  Destructive oxidation of surfaces or etching for control of surface finishes.

-	Brittle fracture.  Fracture of solids is often due to segregation of foreign materials to grain boundaries.

-	Thermionic emission.  Electron emission from heated filaments in TVs (old), electronic tubes etc.  Rate of emission depends on surface properties.

-	Crystal growth.  Growth from solution or from the vapor phase depends on reactions on surfaces and on diffusion on surfaces.

-	Semiconductor properties and processing.  As the size of devices decreases the surface-to-volume ratio increases and surfaces begin to have an important influence on physical properties.

-	Nanophase materials.  Solid materials with grains of nanometer dimensions have extremely high grain boundary densities and extraordinary properties.

** Historical Development

-	Solids were found to cause reactions.
	Priestley (1775) CH_{3}CH_{2}OH decomposition on Cu.
	Davy (1817) CO and H_2 oxidation on Pt. Miner’s lamp.

-	Reactivity increased with porosity.  One idea was that the surfaces compress gasses in pores and cause reaction. This was debunked by the fact that porous metal surfaces differ in reactivity.

-	Van’t Hoff and Sabatier show that surfaces affect the rate but not the equilibrium constant of a reaction.  This is a major milestone in the development of chemical thermodynamics.  Demonstrates that the equilibrium constant is path independent.

-	Several catalytic processes are developed for commerce.
 +	Messel (1875) 	SO_2 + $\frac{1}{2}$ O_2 \rightarrow SO_3
 +	Mond (1888)	CH_4 + $\frac{1}{2}$ O_2 \rightarrow CO + 2 H_2
 +	Sabatier (1902)	C_{2}H_{4} + H_2 \rightarrow C_{2}H_{6}
 +	Haber (1905)	N_2 + 3 H_2 \rightarrow 2 NH_3

-	Langmuir (1915) works on the development of long-life light bulbs for GE and studies the adsorption of gases on hot filaments.

-	Davisson and Germer (1927) observe the diffraction of electron from the surface of a Ni crystal and demonstrate that this is due to the wave nature of the electron.  Quantum mechanics is proved!

-	Modern surface science is born in the 1960’s as an outgrowth of space science and the development of instrumentation for achieving ultra-high vacuum (10^{-10} Torr) environments.

** Modern Surface Science

-	Atomistic level study of surface imposes extremely stringent demands on experimental methods.

-	The total amount of material at the surface of a solid is extremely small.  10^{15} atoms per cm^2 or 10^{-9} moles.

-	The surface must be analyzed in the presence of a bulk solid whose contribution to any measurement could swamp that of the surface.

** Surface Sensitivity

-	Surface sensitivity must be achieved in order to avoid studying the bulk of a solid rather than the surface of interest.

-	Electrons and ions interact very strongly with matter and so they cannot penetrate or escape from the bulk of a solid.  In scattering or emission experiments they only sample the surface.

#+caption: The XPS experiment with electrons coming from the surface only.  X-rays penetrate the surface but electrons photemitted from the bulk cannot escape.

*************** TODO consider redrawing in inkscape
*************** END


#+caption: The universal curve of electron mean free paths in solids.  The mean free path is the mean distance traveled before an electron is scattered by an atom.  This curve has been obtained from measurements made with many materials.
[[./images/mean-free-path.png]]
*************** TODO replace with my version, which i have to find
*************** END

-	Ions are even more surface sensitive than electrons.  Low energy ions (less than 100 eV) do not penetrate the bulk at all.

-	Surface sensitive spectroscopies can almost always be classified into one of four types.
	
  +	ion (or $e^-$)  in  $\rightarrow$  ion (or $e^-$)  out
  +	ion (or $e^-$)  in $\rightarrow$  photon  out
  +	photon  in $\rightarrow$  ion (or $e^-$)  out
  +	photon  in  $\rightarrow$  photon  out

#+caption: Photon in \rightarrow photon out only detecting sulfur atoms on a surface.  If there were high concentrations of sulfur in the bulk then the bulk signal would swamp the signal from the surface atoms.
[[./images/photon-in-photon-out.png]]

** Surface Cleanliness

-	During the course of an experiment (which may be many minutes to many hours) the state of the surface must remain stable (clean or otherwise).  This means that if one studies a clean surface it must not become contaminated by collisions with gas phase molecules.
	
-	Consider the flux of molecules colliding with a surface.

$F = \frac{1}{4}N_g \langle \nu \rangle$

Where $F$ is the flux (molecules/m^2/s), $N_g$ is the gas molecular density, (molecules/m^3), and $\langle \nu \rangle$ is the mean molecular speed of the gas (m/s).

The mean molecular speed is given by kinetic theory:

$\langle \nu \rangle = \sqrt{\frac{8 k T}{\pi m}}$

Where $k$ is the Boltzman constant (1.38 \times 10^{-23} J/K), $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $m$ is the molar mass (kg).

The ideal gas law gives the density.

$N_g = \frac{n}{V} = \frac{P}{k T}$ 

where $P$ is the pressure, $n$ is moles of gas in the volume.

Putting this together we finally have the flux as

$F = \frac{P}{\sqrt{2 \pi m k T}}$

Let us consider an example at $P = 1$ bar, $T = 300$ K, and $m = 30$ amu. We will show how to do this in Python.[fn:1]

#+BEGIN_SRC python -n -r -l "#(ref:%s)"
import numpy as np

P = 1.0              # bar
T = 300.0            # K
m = 30.0             # amu
kb = 1.3807e-23      # J/K

# conversion factors
amu2kg = 1.660538921e-27
bar2Pa = 100000.0
m2cm = 100.0

F = (P * bar2Pa) / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi * m *amu2kg * kb * T))
print 'The flux = {0:1.2e} mlc/cm^2/s'.format(F / m2cm**2)    #(ref:format)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The flux = 2.78e+23 mlc/cm^2/s

In line [[(format)]] we use the syntax {0:1.2e} to format the answer in scientific notation with two decimal places.

Note the order of magnitude, about 0.5 moles of gas hit a square centimeter, every second. A typical density of surface atoms is \rho_s = 2.7 \times 10^{14} atoms/cm^2. The collision frequency is then given by:

$Z_c = \frac{F}{\rho_s} \approx 10^9$

That is, each surface atom is bombarded about 1 billion times a second! Let us assume that we could start with a clean surface, and that every molecule that hits the surface sticks. We can estimate adsorption rates from the flux then. 

| Pressure (bar) | adsorption rate (molecules/sec) |
|----------------+---------------------------------|
| 1              | 10^9/sec                        |
| 10${}^{-9}$    | 1/sec                           |
| 10${}^{-12}$   | 1/hr                            |

You can see that we must have pressures less than 1 \times 10^{-13} bar to keep surfaces clean for hours at a time to do experiments. Of course not every molecule that hits sticks, so this is only an approximate analysis.

* Structure of Solid Surfaces

In this section we review the structure of solid surfaces. Recommended readings include chapter 2 in citealp:masel96:_princ and chapter 2 in cite:somorjai10:_introd.

-	The crystalline structure of solids has been observed since antiquity.

-	The existence of crystals and the fact they could be subdivided into identical crystals lead to the original ideas that matter was formed of some elementary components with characteristic shape.

-	Structure is defined by the positions of all atoms of all types in a solid.

$$\left{\left(x_i^m, y_i^m, z_i^m \right) \right} i \in I, m-type$$ [fn:2]

-	When a crystal is cleaved or sliced it exposes a surface with atoms in some ordered array.

- 	Electron diffraction first proved the existence of atomic order at crystal surfaces (Davisson and Germer, 1927).

-	The first direct observation of atoms was on surfaces and was made using Field Ion Microscopy (Muller and Bahadur, Oct. 11, 1955).

#+caption: Field ion emission microscope.  The metal tips has a high applied potential (\approx 25 kV).  He atoms are ionized at the points of high field gradient (atoms at step edges and then accelerated away from the tip along the field lines.  They are imaged on a phosphorus screen.
[[./images/fem-unknown-origin.jpg]]

#+caption: Field ion micrograph of a tungsten tip.  The atomic structures of various planes are easily observable.
[[./images/Field-ion-micrograph-unknown-origin.jpg]]

- In general we consider three types of solids and the surfaces that
  they expose:

  + Amorphous – no long range structure or relationship between the
    positions of atoms.

  + Periodic – the structure is based on a unit cell that is repeated
    in space through translation.

  + Quasi-periodic – the structure has long range order in the sense
    that there are rules that define the positions of all atoms based
    on the positions of a few, but there is no ‘unit cell’ and no
    translational repetition of the structure.
- All the surfaces that we will discuss are based on periodic
  structures and thus some discussion of symmetry is needed.

** Symmetry
-	Symmetry is one of the most powerful tools available for
        understanding and describing the structure of molecules and
        solids.

-	Symmetry often dictates some of the important properties of
        molecules, solids, and surfaces.

-	The existence of dipole moments of molecules can be determined
        immediately from symmetry arguments: CO_2, H_{2}O. Here is an example.

[[./images/dipoles.png]]

- Second harmonic generation of light occurs only in crystals with no
  inversion symmetry.

[[./images/no-inversion-symmetry-example.png]]

We will see later that symmetry determines which vibrational modes are visible in a vibrational spectroscopy experiment.

*** 	Point Symmetry

-	Point group symmetry is used to describe isolated molecules.

-	The symmetry elements that can exist in molecules are :
	+ mirror planes,
	+ rotational axes,
	+ inversion symmetry, and
	+ rotation-reflection axes.
	  

*** 	Symmetry in 1D

-	In extended dimensional spaces symmetry is defined by translational periodicity combined with symmetry elements.

-	The constraint of translational periodicity limits the types of symmetry elements that can be considered.

-	There are two elements that are needed to define the structure of a periodic solid: a lattice and a basis.

-	The lattice is a set of abstract points related to one another by translational periodicity which divide space into unit cells.

[[./images/1d-lattice.png]]

The positions of each of the points are the set {x_n}  related by 

$$ x_n = x_0 + n \cdot a$$  $n \in I$	

-	The basis is the set of atoms which are positioned at identical positions {b_i} within each of the unit cells.

-	The positions of atoms in the unit cell are usually given in terms of the lattice vector lengths, b = 0 $\rightarrow$ 1.

[[./images/atomic-basis.png]]

The position of any atom in the solid can then be given as

$$ x_{i,n} = x_0 + (n + b_i) \cdot a$$

where $i$ is the atom #, and $n$ is the unit cell number.

-	A symmetry element relates the position of two or more atoms (of the same type) within the unit cell to one another.

-	Specifying the position of one atom and the existence of a symmetry element immediately implies the existence and dictates the position of one or more additional atoms.

[[./images/mirror-plane.png]]

-	The mirror plane supplies a rule for relating the positions of identical points in the lattice or objects of the basis.


-	A mirror plane at position $x^m$ maps a point or atom at a position $x$ into an identical point or atom at position $x' = x^m+(^xm-x) = 2x^m-x$.


Example : Consider the fact that we have atoms at positions  $x_{1,n}$

$$x_{1,n} = x+0 + b^m \cdot a$$

and a mirror plane at

$ x^m = x_0 + b^m \cdot a$.


This implies the presence of a set of identical atoms at positions  $x_{2,n}$.

\begin{eqnarray}			 
x_{1,n} &\implies& 2 x^m - x_{1,n} \\
x_{2,n} &=& (2 x_0 + 2b^m \cdot a) - (x_0 + (n + b_1)) \cdot a) \\
        &=& x_0 + (2 b^m - n - b_1) \cdot a
\end{eqnarray}

If the position of the mirror plane happened to be chosen such that b^m = $\frac{1}{2}$ then this would generate all the other atoms in the unit cell shown above.

In other words this generates the positions of the entire set of atoms at positions b_2 within each of the unit cells.




*** Symmetry in 2D

- When one slices a plane through a 3D lattice it generates a surface
  with the periodicity of a 2D lattice.

- Note that the surface of a real solid is not really 2D.  It has some
  depth since it consists of atoms that are not necessarily all
  constrained to lie in the plane.  The periodicity that we think of
  is actually due to the projection of the 3D semi-infinite solid onto
  the hypothetical plane that defines the surface.

- Also, realize that the act of cutting a 3D transitionally periodic
  solid destroys the periodicity in the direction normal to the cut.
  It leaves only translational periodicity in the two directions
  parallel to the cutting surface.

**** 2D Lattices

-	Symmetry in 2D is defined by a lattice of points combined with several symmetry elements.

-	The lattice in 2D is defined by two vectors which define the sides of the unit cells  .

-	The need that the lattice span all space with translational periodicity constrains the lattice vectors to fall into one of five types known as Bravais lattices.

[[./images/bravais-lattices.png]]

- One thing to note is that the unit cell for the lattice that is
  called centered rectangular doesn’t look rectangular.  However, the
  unit cell can be redrawn in such a way that it is rectangular but
  has a lattice point at the center and an angle of \gamma = 90$^\circ{}$.

- This unit cell is no longer “primitive” because it has more than one
  lattice point per unit cell.  It is important to distinguish between
  primitive and non-primitive lattices.  In a non-primitive lattice
  the points are truly equivalent and therefore there will be atoms
  that are equivalent and thus indistinguishable.

**** Symmetry Elements

- In 2D there are three types of symmetry elements that are consistent
  with the constraint of translational periodicity.

 1. 	Rotation Axes : 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-fold
 2. 	Mirror planes
 3. 	Glide planes (screw axes according to Masel)

[[./images/2D-symmetry-examples.png]]

-	Note that not all of these symmetry elements must be specified explicitly.

-	Specifying two may imply the existence of others.

-	The symmetry of the surface will be equal to or lower than that of the corresponding Bravais lattice.

-	Combining the five Bravais lattices with the possible symmetry elements results in seventeen 2D space groups.  All 2D periodic structures fall into one of these groups.

-	Consider just those that have the square Bravais lattice.

[[./images/square-bravais-lattices.png]]

-	Note that every one of the symmetry operations can be used to generate one point in the lattice from any other.


Example: Consider a four-fold axis at the origin (0,0) and a point at (x,y).

[[./images/4-fold-rotation.png]]

These transformations can be written down as matrices.  The notation for the application of a rotation about fourfold axis by 90$^\circ{}$ is $\hat{C}_4^{(1)}$.

[[./images/rotation-matrices.png]]

Note also that there is a rigorous mathematical meaning to these matrix operations.  Two rotations by 90$^\circ{}$ about a fourfold axis would be represented by the following.

[[./images/two-4fold-matrices.png]]

This is the basis for a very powerful set of ideas that form the basis of "group theory".cite:carter98:_molec_symmet,bishop73:_group_chemis

Before continuing, we briefly show how to verify the results above. In python we have three options to describe a matrix, and it is important to know the differences. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python -n -k -r
C41_list = [[0, -1], 
            [1,  0]]  #(ref:list)

C41_array = np.array([[0, -1], 
                      [1,  0]])  #(ref:array)

C41_matrix = np.matrix([[0, -1],     #(ref:matrix)
                        [1,  0]])

C41_matrix = np.matrix([[0, -1],[1,  0]]) #(ref:matrix-alt)
#+END_SRC

In line [[(list)]] above, we created a list of lists; that is, there are two lists inside a list. This is not a matrix, and does not act like a matrix. 

In line [[(array)]] we created a numpy.array. This is closer to a matrix, but most mathematical operations act element-wise.

In line [[(matrix)]] we create a numpy.matrix object. This acts like a matrix for mathematical operations.

In each of the three examples discussed above, the second row of the data was aligned with spaces so you could "see" the intended arrangement of numbers. Since the second row is "inside" a pair of brackets or parentheses, this indentation is meaningless. It is perfectly fine to define the matrix as in line [[(matrix-alt)]], it is just a little harder to read.

Now we consider verifying that two four-fold rotations are equivalent to a two fold rotation. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python -n -k -r
import numpy as np

C21 = np.matrix([[-1, 0], [0, -1]])

C41 = np.matrix([[0, -1],     #(ref:matrix)
                 [1,  0]])

print(C41 * C41)               #(ref:dot)

print C41 * C41 == C21         #(ref:equal)
print np.all(C41 * C41 == C21) #(ref:all)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [[-1  0]
:  [ 0 -1]]
: [[ True  True]
:  [ True  True]]
: True

In line [[(array)]] we define a matrix. This is similar to a matrix in Matlab, except that you have to use a matrix function to create it. The rows are aligned for visual clarity. Because the rows are inside the function parentheses, the indentation of the second row is unimportant. In line [[(dot)]] we multiply the matrix with itself. This works on a matrix, but not on a list or array. 

You can visually see that the product of the two 4-fold matrices is equal to a 2-fold rotation matrix. In line [[(equal)]] we compare the two quantities. Note the comparison is element-wise, and we get a new matrix of Boolean values. That is inconvenient to examine, we want a single value saying whether the matrices are equal or not. In line [[(all)]] we use the numpy.all command to tell us whether all of the elements in the matrix are True or not.

*** Symmetry in 3D

-	Real surfaces are formed by slicing planes through 3D object.

-	If the 3D solid has some periodicity or is crystalline then the surface that is produced by the cut will also have periodicity and symmetry.

-	In 3D there are 14 possible Bravais lattices that will fill space with translational periodicity.

-	The symmetry operations that can exist in 3D are :
  +	mirror planes
  +	rotations
  +	inversion
  +	rotation translation (screw axes)

- Combination of the Bravais lattices with these symmetry elements
gives /230/ possible 3D space groups.

- The only metal with the simple cubic structure is Polonium.

[[./images/cubic-lattice.png]]

- Most metals have bulk structures that fall into the classes: face
centered cubic, body centered cubic or hexagonal close packed.

- Both fcc and hcp are close packed structures of spheres.

[[./images/bcc-lattice.png]]

[[./images/fcc-lattice.png]]

[[./images/hcp-lattice.png]]

- 	Note that the two atoms in the hcp lattice are not identical.
        They are positioned above triangles of different orientation.
        As a result the hcp lattice has two atoms per unit cell but is
        still primitive.

** Surfaces of the Simple Cubic Lattice

-	Start by considering these just to get the idea of taking
        slices of three dimensional structures. Depending on how you cut the surface, you can get square, rectangular, or even hexagonal arrangements of atoms at the surface.

[[./images/square-lattice-surface.png]]

[[./images/rectangular-lattice.png]]

[[./images/hexagonal-lattice.png]]

** 	Miller Indices

-	There are an infinite number of planes that can be cut through
        a 3D lattice. We need a way to name the planes.

- For every vector direction that one defines in the lattice there is
  a set of planes perpendicular to that vector.

-	In a lattice that has some symmetry to it there will be
        equivalent directions that expose identical faces.

#+caption: The arrows indicate symmetrically equivalent surfaces.
[[./images/equivalent-faces.png]]

-	For atomic lattices or even molecular lattices one does not usually think of cutting "through" atoms or molecules. Cuts pass between atoms and expose those whose centers lie to one side of the cutting plane.

[[./images/2-4a.png]]

-	If one considers just the lattice then it doesn’t matter at what position along a given direction that the cut is made.  However, if one considered the contents of the unit cell then it does matter. 

[[./images/2-4b.png]]

*** Miller Index Formulation

-	For a plane cut through a lattice:
 1.	Find the intersections (b_x, b_y, b_z) with b_i > 1 along each of
        the three lattice vectors (in units of the vector length).
 2.	Find the lowest common denominator of the three lengths.

$n = lcd\left{\frac{1}{b_x}, \frac{1}{b_y}, \frac{1}{b_z} \right}$

 3. 	Define the Miller indices of the plane as:

 $(h,k,l) = \left( \frac{n}{b_x}, \frac{n}{b_y}, \frac{n}{b_z} \right )$.

 4. If $b_x = \infty$ then $h = 0$

[[./images/2-5.png]]

That example is pretty easy to work out in your head. Here is how to compute the lowest common denominator in Python.  Note that the lowest common denominator is the same as the lowest common multiple of the numbers in the divisor, and is related to the greatest common divisor.  [fn:3] Also, the lowest common denominator of three numbers is the same as the lowest common denominator of one number with the lowest common denominator of the other two numbers.
#+BEGIN_SRC python -n -r -l "#(ref:%s)"
from fractions import gcd                           #(ref:gcd)

def LCM(a, b):                                      #(ref:def)
    'returns the least common multiple of a and b'  #(ref:doc)
    return a * b / gcd(a, b)

print(LCM(1, LCM(1, 2)))                            #(ref:print)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2

In line [[(gcd)]] we import the =gcd= function from the fractions module. Line [[(def)]] illustrates a new python concept: the definition of a function. The function is called =LCM= and it takes two arguments. Line [[(doc)]] is simply a documentation string that tells us what the function does.  Note that the body of the function /must/ be indented! This is a critical difference between python and Matlab. The standard indentation is 4 spaces. Finally, in line [[(print)]], we use the functional form of the print command to output the result.  


-	Note that for the hexagonal lattice it is quite common to use
        four indices $(h,k,l,m)$ as though there were four vectors
        needed to define the unit cell. This is illustrated below.

[[./images/2-6.png]]

-	In this case the four indices are not unique and the
        relationship between them is that

				$h + k = -l$.

** Common Low Miller Index Surface Structures 

-	The most common and important crystal structures for metals are the fcc, bcc, and hcp.

-	The most common and important structures for the semiconductors are the diamond and zincblende structures.

-	Of these, the most important surfaces are usually the low Miller index surfaces.  These tend to be closely packed arrays that are thermodynamically stable.

-	Metal crystallites in catalysts usually expose low Miller index surfaces.

** 	High Miller Index Surfaces

-	Surfaces cut along planes that are not low Miller index planes can have very complex structures and are certainly not close packed.

-	The structures that are exposed by high Miller index cuts are :
 +	monoatomic steps, and
 +	kinked steps.

[[./images/fcc-511.png]]

[[./images/fcc-643.png]]

- 	All possible structure can be viewed on the web at the site:

http://surfexp.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/

-	It is important to realize that the steps have certain structure to them also and that they can be thought of as planes that project up through the surface.

-	The fcc(511) surface can be thought of as (111) steps combined with the (100) terraces.

-	When thinking about the step structure it is important to remember the atoms within the original unit cell.

** 	Surface Relaxation

-	Cleavage of a 3D solid removes one degree of translational periodicity.  The semi-infinite solid is now only periodic in the plane parallel to the cut.

-	Clearly this must have some effect on the positions of atoms at the surface.  They are now only bonded to atoms on one side and must react to minimize total energy.

-	The universally observed effect is that there is a contraction of the layers at the surface.

-	The contraction is due to the contraction of electron density into the bulk of the solid.

[[./images/2-7.png]]

-	For the close packed surfaces the contraction is minimal; 1-3% of the plane spacing.

-	For non-close packed low Miller index surfaces the contraction can be 5-10% of the plane spacing.

-	For rough surfaces the contraction is greater as a percentage of the surface plane spacing because the surface plane spacing is lower.  The absolute contraction is not necessarily much different from that of a low Miller index surface.

-	Relaxation preserves the 2D translational periodicity of the bulk.

**  	Reconstruction

-	The need to minimize the total energy of the surface can drive the surface to much more drastic rearrangements than relaxation.

-	Reconstruction involves an atomic rearrangement that changes the 2D translational periodicity of the surface.

[[./images/reconstructions-1.png]]

[[./images/reconstructions-2.png]]

-	The tendency is that the close packed or low Miller index surfaces of metals are thermodynamically stable.

-	A number of the reconstructions that have been observed can be rationalize in terms of a surface taking on close packed structures.  The Au(110)-(2 \times 1) forms facets of (111) surfaces.

-	One of the types of reconstruction that should be obvious is the coalescence of steps.  Steps are high energy features but are prevented from coalescence by dipole repulsion.

-	At high enough step density, however, these become unstable and do coalesce into polyatomic steps.


* Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED)

-	As mentioned the structures of surface are not just what they would appear to be from cleaving of the bulk crystal.  Reconstructions can occur that change the periodicity of the surface lattice.  Relaxations cause changes in the layer spacings at solid surfaces.  Furthermore, adsorbed atoms and molecules can create new surface lattices, induce reconstructions or even remove the reconstructions of the clean surfaces.

-	There are several types of structural experiments that have been developed.  The most common are Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM).
  
-	LEED is the primary way in which the structures of surfaces and the adsorbed layers have been determined quantitatively and is quite commonly done by most research groups in the field of surface science.

-	LEED can be used in one of two modes :
 +	determination of unit cells of surfaces and adsorbed overlayers, and
 +	true quantitative structure determination.

-	The quantitative determination of structure is very difficult and highly computationally intensive.

[[./images/leed-optics.png]]

#+caption: Potential energy profile seen by the electron beam.
[[./images/pe-leed-profile.png]]

-	The phosphorus screen allows easy and cheap visualization of the LEED pattern.  Usually a photograph is taken of the back side of the screen.  This projects the diffraction pattern onto a plane.

-	More complex methods of detection allow measurement of the diffraction spot profiles and the intensities.


** Diffraction

-	Diffraction requires wavelike behavior of the electron.  This was postulated by de Broglie.

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \sqrt{\frac{150}{E_{kin}}} $$

This gives the wavelength in \AA for kinetic energy in eV.

-	Let us review the  rules of diffraction from a lattice in 1-D.  Basically diffraction is a process in which a wave is incident on an array of atoms.  To first order the waves scattered by each atom are spherical waves propagating with the same wavelength as the incident wave.  At long distances from the array the scattered waves can be considered to be planes waves from each source atom.

[[./images/3-3-diffraction.png]]

•	Diffraction occurs when the distances traveled by the scattered plane waves all differ by some integral multiple of the wavelength. A wave with wavelength \lambda is incident on a 1D lattice with spacing $a$ at an angle \phi_0.  

[[./images/3-4-diffraction-angles.png]]

•	In order to have constructive interference and obtain a diffracted beam the waves scattering off adjacent lattice points must travel distances which differ by integral multiples of the wavelength.

•	The diffraction condition must be that

$$a(\sin \phi_h - \sin \phi_0) = h \lambda$$

for $h \in I$. For a given incident angle \phi_0 this determines the angles \phi_h at which diffracted beams appear.

•	Another way of writing this equation is to think of the lattice spacing as a vector $\overrightarrow{a}$  and the incident and scattered waves as traveling along directions given by the unit vectors \hat{s}_0  and \hat{s}_h.

[[./images/3-5-vector-diffraction.png]]

•	Then the diffraction condition can be written as
$$\overrightarrow{a}\cdot (\hat{s}_h - \hat{s}_0) = h \lambda$$

Consider the 2D diffraction problem from a lattice with vectors $\overright arrow{a}_1$  and $\overrightarrow{a}_2$.  The beam is incident along a vector \hat{s}_0  and diffracting in a direction \hat{s}_{hk}.

[[./images/3-6-2d-diffraction.png]]

•	Now the diffraction conditions are given by

		$$\overrightarrow{a}_1 \cdot (\hat {s}_{hk} - \hat{s}_0) = h \lambda$$		 

		and
 		$$\overrightarrow{a}_2 \cdot (\hat {s}_{hk} - \hat{s}_0) = k \lambda$$.

Both must be satisfied in order to get diffraction

** The reciprocal lattice
For any lattice vectors, $(\overrightarrow{a}_1, \overrightarrow{a}_2)$, we can define a new set of vectors, which we call the reciprocal lattice $(\overrightarrow{a}_1^*, \overrightarrow{a}_2^*)$ based on these definitions:

[[./images/3-7-reciprocal.png]]

•	Note that the reciprocal lattice is periodic and has symmetry just like the real space lattice.

•	The power of this construction is that it provides us with the solutions to the diffraction problem.  The directions in which diffraction occurs are given by

$$\hat{s} - \hat{s}_0 = h \lambda \overrightarrow{a}_1^* - k \lambda \overrightarrow{a}_2^*$$.

Let us consider a general approach to computing the reciprocal lattice. First, we consider how to represent the vectors in the form of a matrix. For the two lattice vectors $\overrightarrow{a}_1$ and $\overrightarrow{a}_2$, we express them in a matrix as: $A = [\overrightarrow{a}_1 \overrightarrow{a}_2]$. We next consider the reciprocal lattice vectors, $A^* = \left[ \begin{array}{c}  \overrightarrow{a}_1^* \\ \overrightarrow{a}_2^* \end{array}\right].$ Now, we have the following equation: $A \cdot A^* = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. We can readily solve for the reciprocal lattice vectors as $A^* = I \cdot A^{-1} = A^{-1}$.

Let us consider a specific example where $a_1 = 1x + 0y$ and $a_2 = 0x + 2y$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python -n -r -k 
import numpy as np

a1 = [1, 0]               #(ref:a1)
a2 = [0, 2]

A = np.vstack([a1, a2])   #(ref:vstack)
print('A = \n{0}'.format(A))

Astar = np.linalg.inv(A)    #(ref:inv)

a1star= Astar[0]            #(ref:a1*)
a2star = Astar[1]
print 'a1* = {0}'.format(a1star)
print 'a1* = {0}'.format(a2star)

# Verify the requirements.
print np.dot(a1, a1star)    #(ref:dot)
print np.dot(a1, a2star)
print np.dot(a2, a1star)
print np.dot(a2, a2star)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: A = 
: [[1 0]
:  [0 2]]
: a1* = [ 1.  0.]
: a1* = [ 0.   0.5]
: 1.0
: 0.0
: 0.0
: 1.0

This method works generally for 2 and 3 dimensional lattices. Some notes about the code above:
1. In line [[(a1)]] we represent the components of the vector as a /list/.
2. In line [[(vstack)]] we create an array by using numpy.vstack. This makes the columns of the array the components of the vector. An array is not the same as a matrix!
3. In line[[ (inv)]] we calculate the inverse of the array. Note that now the components of the reciprocal lattice vectors are in the /rows/ of the resulting array.
4. In line [[(a1*)]] we use indexing to extract the first row. In Python, indexing starts at 0.
5. In line [[(dot)]] we must use the numpy.dot function to get the matrix multiplication, or dot product of the two vectors. The * operator will perform element-wise multiplication.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] We have to import the numpy library. Here we import it with the name np, and then access the functions using a dot notation. For example, the sqrt function is np.sqrt.

[fn:2] Read this equation as the (x,y,z) coordinates of the i^{th} atom of type m for every atom $i$ in the structure $I$.

 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
